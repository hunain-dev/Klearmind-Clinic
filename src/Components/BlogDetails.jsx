Traditional antidepressants, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), focus on regulating serotonin hormone levels. Ketamine is unique. It acts on NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and increases glutamate levels. Glutamate is one of the brain’s most powerful chemical messengers..",

            "Given in low doses, ketamine infusion therapy can produce rapid and significant improvement in symptoms, often within a few hours to days. Compared to antidepressants, increasing your glutamate levels with ketamine yields a greater and more substantial impact on brain cells with only one single dose."
