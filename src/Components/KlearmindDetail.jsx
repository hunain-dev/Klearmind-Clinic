Examples include anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",

Traditional antidepressants, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), focus on regulating serotonin hormone levels. Ketamine is unique. It acts on NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and increases glutamate levels. Glutamate is one of the brain’s most powerful chemical messengers..",

Compared to antidepressants, increasing your glutamate levels with ketamine yields a greater and more substantial impact on brain cells with only one single dose."

            "Ketamine works differently than antidepressants, which can take weeks to months to produce results. Traditional antidepressants, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), focus on regulating serotonin hormone levels. Ketamine is unique. It acts on NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and increases glutamate levels. Glutamate is one of the brain’s most powerful chemical messengers..",
            "Increasing glutamate helps to strengthen and restore the neural connections and pathways in the areas of the brain most impaired by depression.",
            "So this is what supports our brain's neuroplasticity. As a result, we experience positive changes in brain circuit function and improved mood regulation.",
            "Given in low doses, ketamine infusion therapy can produce rapid and significant improvement in symptoms, often within a few hours to days. Compared to antidepressants, increasing your glutamate levels with ketamine yields a greater and more substantial impact on brain cells with only one single dose."

Once you’re settled in your chair, your team at KlearMind will let you know when the IV has begun. Patients report a calm and relaxing feeling. As the treatment progresses, you might feel increasingly light or faint. Some patients report feeling like they are floating.",
            "Some individuals experience a sensation of a slight separation between themselves and their bodies. For some, your hands and feet may feel very far away. Others progressively feel more separation between themselves and the different parts of consciousness. For example, their thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and perception all seem like separate experiences. For reference, these sensations are considered to be the dissociative effects of ketamine.",

Some may even feel distant from those negative symptoms.",

During these sessions, you will work with your clinician to determine long-term treatment plans as needed.
